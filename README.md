## Problem solving using C#

To be familiar with C#, I solved some problems using C#. 

As I always use a code template for contest programming, here also I made a template before starting solving.
By solving these programming problems, I have improved my implementation skill. I learned about the collection framework of C# and its different uses.

I solved different types of problems using this language. For example, binary search, graph, DP, math, etc.
